# Game Enrichment Pipeline — Project Log

## Project overview
Extract Themes and Main Features from 200–500 MGA game PowerPoint decks,
standardise against a market-aligned SEO taxonomy, resolve localisation variants,
output an enriched CSV for casino site SEO.

## Token usage
| Session | Tokens used | Cumulative |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Planning (Claude.ai) | ~18,000 | 18,000 |

**Category split for Session 6a:** Feature 95% (PDF pipeline + PP side-channel + new market xlsx column), Bug fix 5% (per-market commercial-name lookup that fixed 85 unmatched folders). No Rework, no Cleanup.

**Category split for Session 6b:** Feature 100% (classification work using 6a infrastructure). No Rework, no Cleanup.

**Category split for Session 6c:** Feature 100% (PDF Description backfill + new merge/diff post-processor). No Rework, no Cleanup.

**Category split for Session 6d:** Bug fix 100% (per-market celebrity validation in `generate_market_xlsx.py`). No Feature, Rework, or Cleanup.

**Category split for Session 7:** Feature 95% (untagged-games triage + mga.games Playwright scraper + 240 web_extract JSONs in pipeline format), Bug fix 5% (cross-market fallback added to `generate_market_xlsx.find_base_key`, recovering 19 already-enriched-but-blank xlsx rows). No Rework, no Cleanup.

**Category split for Session 7b:** Feature 100% (web-extract classification pipeline + 84 new classified games). No Bug fix, no Rework, no Cleanup. Sub-agent total ~330k + main context ~30k = ~360k.

**Category split for Session 8:** Bug fix 50% (loose-match resolver fallback recovering 41 Bucket A naming-mismatch rows) / Feature 50% (17 newly-bridged web_extracts classified via 2 sub-agent batches). Sub-agent total ~71k + main context ~80k = ~150k.

**Category split for Session 9:** Feature 100% (20 alias/new market_names rows added + 4 new base_keys classified via 1 sub-agent batch). Sub-agent total ~32k + main context ~80k = ~112k.

**Budget status (Session 9):** No `dev/ref/budget.md` exists (flagged since 6a). 9 ran in ~112k tokens — comparable to 6c (300k) but smaller scope. Cumulative project tokens: ~3.24M.

**Context limits / splitting (Session 9):** No context-limit issues. Single-batch session with 4 new base_keys; no waves needed.

**File-size flag (Session 9):** `agents/pdf_extractor.py` newly crossed the 500-line threshold — currently **509 lines** (was 474 in 6a, grew by 35 lines for the loose-match fallback in 8 + nothing in 9). Suggest a split discussion next session — natural seam: extract the resolver helpers (`_norm`, `_norm_loose`, `_build_commercial_lookup`, `_resolve_base_key_per_market`) into a new `agents/resolver.py` and have both `pdf_extractor.py` and `generate_market_xlsx.py` import from there (would also dedupe the loose-match logic that's currently inlined in both files). `main.py` still 673 lines (flagged since 6a — unchanged). `generate_market_xlsx.py` at 365, `agents/extractor.py` at 392, `agents/consolidator.py` at 389 — comfortably under.

**Budget status:** No `dev/ref/budget.md` exists (also flagged in 6a/6b notes) — no per-session budget defined to compare against. 6c estimated ~250k, actual ~300k (+20%) — within margin given the unplanned merge/diff infrastructure work. Cumulative project tokens: ~2.35M.

**Context limits / splitting:** 6c did NOT hit context limits. No splitting needed. `main.py` remains at **673 lines** (>500-line threshold flagged since 6a — split discussion still pending; suggested seam: each `cmd_*` → `agents/cli/<command>.py`). All other modules under 500.

**Budget status (6d):** No `dev/ref/budget.md` exists (flagged since 6a). 6d ran in ~50k tokens — well within any reasonable Bug-fix budget. Cumulative project tokens: ~2.40M.

**Context limits / splitting (6d):** No context-limit issues. `main.py` still 673 lines; `generate_market_xlsx.py` grew 192 → 318 lines, comfortably under 500. No other files crossed thresholds.

**Budget status (Session 7):** No `dev/ref/budget.md` exists (flagged since 6a). 7 ran in ~220k tokens — comparable to 6c (300k). No prior estimate to compare against. Cumulative project tokens: ~2.62M. Sub-agent classification of the 113 web_extracts is deferred to Session 7b — estimated ~300–400k.

**Context limits / splitting (Session 7):** No context-limit issues. `main.py` still 673 lines (unchanged this session). `generate_market_xlsx.py` grew 318 → 341 (added cross-market fallback). All `dev/scrape_*` and `dev/match_*` scripts under 400 lines. No new files crossed 500-line threshold.

**Budget status:** No `dev/ref/budget.md` exists yet — no per-session budget to compare against. Session 6a's 480k tokens used ~60% of the user's current 5-hour Max-plan window. Estimated 6b would push cumulative to ~105% if run back-to-back; **plan is to wait for window reset before 6b** (or split 6b into two sub-sessions).

**Context limits / splitting:** Session deliberately split per plan: 6a (this session, 80 NEW games) → hard pause → 6b (58 NEW games, fresh context) → 6c (47 backfills, fresh context). Did NOT hit context limits this session.

**File-size flag:** `main.py` is now **673 lines** (was 468 after Session 5; +200 from `cmd_extract_pdfs` + subparser wiring). Crosses the 500-line threshold. Suggest discussing a split next session — natural seams: (a) move each `cmd_*` function into `agents/cli/<command>.py` modules and keep `main.py` as the slim subparser entry point, or (b) split into `main_extract.py` / `main_classify.py` / `main_consolidate.py`. `agents/consolidator.py` is at 387, `agents/extractor.py` at 392, `agents/pdf_extractor.py` at 474 — all comfortably under.

## Session log

### Session 0 — Planning (Claude.ai, not Claude Code)
**Status:** Complete
**What was done:**
- Analysed MGA_Products.xlsx: 700 rows, 357 game families, 8 markets

**Date:** 2026-03-16
**Status:** Complete — scaffolding done, architecture updated, ready for classification run

**What was done:**
- Built `agents/theme_classifier.py`, `agents/feature_classifier.py`, `agents/localisation_resolver.py`
- Wired `classify` subcommand into `main.py` (with --dry-run, --include-deactivated flags)
- Attempted API dry-run — API key had no model access (404 on all models)
- **Architecture pivot:** switched from Claude API calls to Claude Code sub-agent approach
  - Each sub-agent processes a batch of 10 games using Max plan tokens
  - 13 sub-agents total, run 3–4 in parallel
  - No API key or credits required
- Ran manual test classification on 5 Megaways games (Option A: classify in-conversation)
- Test results validated: themes/features/confidence scores look correct

### Session 2b — Phase 2: Full classification run (Claude Code)
**Date:** 2026-03-16
**Status:** Complete

**What was done:**
- Classified all 128 games via 13 Claude Code sub-agents (batches of 10)
- Ran sub-agents in 3 waves: wave 1 (4 parallel), wave 2 (4 parallel), wave 3 (5 parallel)
- Ran localisation resolver in main context — merged market data into all classified JSONs
- Validated results: 128 classified, 89 matched to market DB, 39 unmatched

**Classification stats:**
- 89/128 matched to market_names.xlsx families, 39 unmatched (will be flagged)
- 23 games with theme confidence < 0.75 (mostly design-only PPTXs)
- 57 games with feature confidence < 0.75 (Slots3 design PPTXs lack mechanic detail)
- 7 games with no PPTX found
- 34 games with unknown features — 51 unique unknown mechanics captured
- 5 celebrity IPs from Ca/Se variants (Charlie Riina, Lisa Mancini, Joshua Guvi, Ron Josol, Taya Valkyrie)
- Many additional celebrities detected from game names (Chiquito de la Calzada, Samantha Fox, Mario Vaquerizo, etc.)

**Token breakdown:** ~490k sub-agents + ~40k main context = ~530k (Feature)

**Files modified:**
- `data/classified/*.json` (128 files, gitignored)

**Key findings:** recorded in `dev/ref/stage2-summary.md`

---

### Session 3 — Phase 3: Consolidation + Output (Claude Code)
**Date:** 2026-03-16
**Status:** Complete
**Token category:** Feature

**What was done:**
- Built `agents/consolidator.py` (242 lines) — loads classified JSONs, builds review flags, writes CSVs
- Added 4 new subcommands to `main.py`: `consolidate`, `merge-review`, `stats`, `run-all`
- Generated all 3 output CSVs (UTF-8-BOM, pipe-separated multi-values, sorted flagged-first)
- Normalized category casing (SLOTS3/Slots3 → SLOTS3)
- Generated unknown features report with suggested mappings (via sub-agent)
- Expanded `seo_taxonomy.json` v2.0: 6 new tags, 35 new Spanish aliases
- Tested merge-review round-trip successfully
- Updated CLAUDE.md with new commands + taxonomy maintenance docs

**Output stats:**
- 128 games → `games_enriched.csv`
- 91 flagged → `review_flagged.csv` (57 low feature conf, 39 no market match, 34 unknown features, 23 low theme conf, 7 no PPTX)
- 51 unknown features → `unknown_features_report.csv` (mapped to 6 new + 5 existing tags, 8 skipped)

**New taxonomy tags:** Nudge & Hold, Minigame, Prize Ladder, Gamble Feature, Multi-Volatility, Twin Spin

**Files created/modified:**
- `agents/consolidator.py` (new)
- `main.py` (updated — 4 new subcommands, 468 lines)
- `config/seo_taxonomy.json` (updated — v2.0, 360 lines)
- `CLAUDE.md` (updated — new commands, taxonomy maintenance section)
- `output/*.csv` (3 files, gitignored)

**Key findings:** recorded in `dev/ref/stage3-summary.md`

---

### Session 4 — Human review feedback + HTML report (Claude Code)
**Date:** 2026-03-19
**Status:** Complete
**Token category:** Feature

**What was done:**
- Applied 3 human review feedback items to consolidator pipeline:
  1. SLOTS3 default features: all 91 SLOTS3 games now auto-receive Mini-Games, Bonos Superiores, Dual-Screen Layout
  2. Feature dedup: "Bonus Round" removed when "Bonus Game" present
  3. Renamed "Free Spins" → "Free Rounds" across taxonomy + consolidator
- Updated `seo_taxonomy.json` to v2.1 (renames, new SLOTS3 Standard category, removed Bonus Round from tag list)
- Added `normalize_features()` to consolidator — applies renames, dedup, and SLOTS3 defaults at consolidation time
- Merged 91 human-reviewed rows back into enriched CSV (0 still flagged)
- Built `generate_report.py` → `output/enrichment_report.html` (dark theme, bar charts, EN/ES toggle)

**Files created/modified:**
- `agents/consolidator.py` (modified — added normalize_features, 285 lines)
- `config/seo_taxonomy.json` (modified — v2.1, 364 lines)
- `generate_report.py` (new — HTML report generator)
- `output/enrichment_report.html` (new, gitignored)

---

### Session 5 — Re-run + AM_Masterlist join + PP taxonomy parity (Claude Code)
**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Status:** Complete
**Token category:** Feature

**What was done:**
- Recovered from lost outputs (`output/`, `data/raw_extracts/`, `data/classified/`, `POWERPOINTS/` all gone from disk).
- New PPTX folder downloaded to `data/01_Definicion Productos/` — partial: 62 game folders (MegaWays 11, Slots3 49, Boost&Win 2). Missing: Slots5, Bingo.
- Added `config/AM_Masterlist.xlsx` (6 market sheets, 503 rows total, 232 SPAIN). Used to attach current-live SEO spec data.
- **Code changes:** category normalization in `agents/extractor.py`; new `agents/am_masterlist.py` (load/match/gap-report); new `localise` subcommand in `main.py` (replaces broken API-based `cmd_classify`); 9 AM columns + gap-report write in `agents/consolidator.py`.
- **Pipeline re-run:** Phase 1 (62 extracts) → Phase 2 sub-agents (8 batches × 8 games × 3 waves of 3-3-2 parallel) → localise + AM enrichment → consolidate → HTML report.
- **Outputs:** `games_enriched.csv` (62 rows × 22 cols), `review_flagged.csv` (53 rows), `unknown_features_report.csv` (17), `am_spain_gap_report.csv` (197 rows = 232 AM Spain – 35 covered).
- New: `generate_market_xlsx.py` produces `output/themes_features_by_market.xlsx` — one sheet per AM market (SPAIN, PORTUGAL, .COM, NETHERLANDS, ITALY, COLOMBIA), all 503 AM rows preserved, themes/features populated where the localised name links via market_names.xlsx → base_key → enriched.
- **Taxonomy bumps**: v2.2 (added 'Ancient Civilisations' as explicit umbrella tag — was a category-only token previously). v2.3 (Pragmatic Play parity pass: 18 new themes added — Bees, Pigs, Chickens, Monkeys, Flowers, Phoenix, Goldmine, Cops & Robbers, Train, Scientist, John Hunter, Presidents, Brazil, Irish, Native American, Love, Queen, Cheese).
- **Consistency audit:** 0 unauthorised feature drift, 0 unauthorised theme drift after v2.2; all 12 celebrity-name tags compliant with co-occurrence rule.
- **PP mechanics review** generated as `output/missing_mechanics_review.xlsx` — 5 mechanics with English + Spanish descriptions for Product team review (Hyperplay, Increasing Wilds, Mystery Expanding Symbol, Powernudge, Super Scatter).

**Files created/modified:**
- `agents/extractor.py` — `_normalize_category` helper
- `agents/am_masterlist.py` — NEW
- `agents/consolidator.py` — extended with AM columns + gap report
- `main.py` — new `localise` subcommand, AM Masterlist arg on consolidate
- `config/seo_taxonomy.json` — v2.3
- `generate_market_xlsx.py` — NEW
- `generate_missing_mechanics_xlsx.py` — NEW
- `output/*.csv`, `output/themes_features_by_market.xlsx`, `output/missing_mechanics_review.xlsx`, `output/enrichment_report.html`

---

### Session 6a — PDF-based enrichment + PP candidate side-channel (Claude Code)
**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Status:** Complete. HARD-PAUSE per plan — resume 6b in fresh context via `/catchup`.
**Token category:** Feature

**What was done:**
- Built PDF pipeline: `agents/pdf_extractor.py` (walks 7-market FinalesProducto tree, 4-rule PDF discovery, pypdf+pdfplumber extraction, per-market commercial-name lookup that sidesteps the SPAIN/`.COM` cname quirk) + `extract-pdfs` subcommand in main.py + pypdf/pdfplumber added to requirements.
- Extended consolidator with `description`, `pdf_found`, `pdf_source_language` columns and a new `build_pp_candidate_report()` emitting `output/pp_mechanic_candidates.csv` (4 sanctioned PP mechanics, Powernudge excluded — it remaps to existing `Nudge & Hold`).
- `generate_market_xlsx.py` extended to 5 columns (Description added) with a fallback save-path when target file is open in Excel.
- Survey: 479 game folders scanned, 333 PDFs found, 185 unique base_keys with PDFs.
- Calibration: 1 sub-agent × 4 SLOTS5 EN games = 32k tokens (~8k/game) — far below 80k threshold.
- 80 NEW base_keys classified via 10 sub-agents in 4 waves (3-3-3-1). Schema/PP-leak/coverage validation all pass (`dev/validate_session6a.py`).
- 4 PP candidate hits captured in `output/pp_mechanic_candidates.csv`: 3× Increasing Wilds (Diamond Mine, Explosive Bandit 2, Explosive Wizard Cat), 1× Mystery Expanding Symbol (Dragons Double Pot). Evidence quotes are verbatim and look like genuine matches.

**Coverage delta** in `themes_features_by_market.xlsx`:
| Market | Pre | Post | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| SPAIN | 39 | 83 | +44 |
| PORTUGAL | 11 | 42 | +31 |
| .COM | 9 | 57 | +48 |
| NETHERLANDS | 4 | 15 | +11 |
| ITALY | 6 | 23 | +17 |
| COLOMBIA | 0 | 8 | +8 |
| **Totals** | **69** | **228** | **+159** |

**Files created/modified:**
- `agents/pdf_extractor.py` (NEW)
- `agents/consolidator.py` (description, pp_candidate_report, pdf_found cols)
- `main.py` (extract-pdfs subcommand)
- `generate_market_xlsx.py` (Description col + Excel-locked fallback)
- `requirements.txt` (pypdf, pdfplumber)
- `dev/session6a_batches.py` (NEW — wave builder)
- `dev/validate_session6a.py` (NEW — validation gate)
- `dev/_session6a_batches/PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` + 10 batch files (NEW)
- `data/pdf_extracts/*.json` (185 files, gitignored)
- `data/classified/*.json` (84 new this session, 146 total)
- `output/games_enriched.csv` (146 rows, 7 new cols)
- `output/themes_features_by_market.xlsx` (or `.LATEST.xlsx` if Excel was open)
- `output/pp_mechanic_candidates.csv` (NEW — 4 rows)
- `output/pdf_coverage_survey.csv` (NEW — 479 rows)
- `dev/ref/stage6a-summary.md` (NEW)

**Risks observed (non-blocking):**
- `localisation_resolver.match_extract_to_family` no-match for 51/146 — same SPAIN/.COM cname quirk. Cross-market deliverable still works (joins via AM directly). Fix in 6b if there's headroom.

---

### Session 6d — Per-market celebrity-name validation in market xlsx (Claude Code)
**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Status:** Complete.
**Token category:** Bug fix 100%

**What was done:**
- Added per-row celebrity validation to `generate_market_xlsx.py`. Celebrity tags propagate at base_key level but vary by market — e.g. SPAIN "Lejano Oeste Mania Megaways" was carrying `Ron Josol` (a Canada/Sweden IP variant celebrity) even though Ron Josol isn't in the Spanish game name.
- Strict-full-name match policy (after lowercase + accent-fold + conjunction normalization `& ↔ y ↔ e ↔ and`): each celebrity-name tag must appear as a substring of the localised GameName or it gets pruned. Umbrella `Celebrities` is dropped when no celebrity name survives. Swap-in: any celebrity from the global pool that IS in GameName but missing from themes is added.
- New helpers: `norm_match()`, `load_taxonomy_themes()`, `collect_celebrity_pool()`, `validate_celebrities()`. Existing `norm()` reused.
- New artefact: `output/celebrity_corrections.csv` — audit log of every removal/swap/umbrella drop.
- No changes to `agents/`, `main.py`, `config/seo_taxonomy.json`, or `data/classified/*.json`. `games_enriched.csv` stays per-base_key with the union of celebrities; the per-market xlsx is the cleaned view.

**Results:**
- 60 audit rows: **29 removals**, **2 additions**, **29 umbrella drops**.
- Per-sheet removals: SPAIN 9, ITALY 7, .COM 6, PORTUGAL 5, NETHERLANDS 1, COLOMBIA 1.
- 6× Chiquito SPAIN games lost `Chiquito de la Calzada` (intended outcome of strict-full-name; "Chiquito Halloween" etc. don't carry the full name). User explicitly chose strict policy.
- SPAIN swap-in: `Sonia Monroy En El Planeta Halloween` got `Sonia Monroy` + `Celebrities` added (base_key had no celebrity; SPAIN-localised name introduces her).

**Out of scope:** persisting per-market celebrity overrides back into classified JSONs (would require restructuring storage to per-market-per-base_key); upstream classifier prompt fix for the bleed (separate workstream).

**Files created/modified:**
- `generate_market_xlsx.py` (helpers + row-loop wiring + audit CSV writer)
- `dev/qa-checklist.md` (Session 6d block)
- `output/themes_features_by_market.xlsx` (refreshed; .LATEST sibling if Excel was open)
- `output/celebrity_corrections.csv` (NEW)

---

### Session 6c — PDF Description backfill for 47 Session-5 games (Claude Code)
**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Status:** Complete. Phase 6 done.
**Token category:** Feature 100%

**What was done:**
- Built `dev/session6c_batches.py` (inverted 6b filter: enriched + PDF available = 47 candidates: 9 MEGAWAYS + 38 SLOTS3) and `dev/_session6c_batches/PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` (Description-primary; sub-agents write to `data/classified_6c/`, NOT `data/classified/`).
- 6 batches dispatched as 2 waves of 3 sub-agents each. ~260k tokens for the 6 batches.
- Built `dev/session6c_merge.py` — merges PDF description / pdf_source_language / pdf_found / pp_candidate_mechanics into the Session-5 JSONs while keeping Session 5's themes/features authoritative; logs material disagreements (both confidences ≥0.85 AND tag-set differs) to `output/backfill_diffs.csv`.
- Validation: all 7 checks pass for 185 PDF-sourced JSONs (138 from 6a/6b + 47 newly merged).
- Refreshed `consolidate` + `generate_market_xlsx.py` + `generate_report.py`.

**Disagreement detector:** 34 rows in `output/backfill_diffs.csv` (22 themes, 12 features). Patterns are source-format-driven (PDFs surface different prose vs. PPTX technical tables) and need Product review — not errors.

**PP candidates:** 0 new hits. Total still 4, all from 6a.

**Coverage delta** (Description column in `themes_features_by_market.xlsx`):
| Market | Pre-6c desc | Post-6c desc | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| SPAIN | 83 | 127 | +44 |
| PORTUGAL | 42 | 43 | +1 |
| .COM | 57 | 60 | +3 |
| NETHERLANDS | 15 | 15 | 0 |
| ITALY | 23 | 23 | 0 |
| COLOMBIA | 8 | 8 | 0 |
| **Total** | **228** | **276** | **+48** |

Total enriched market rows unchanged at 278 — 6c only added Description to existing rows.

**Files created/modified:**
- `dev/session6c_batches.py` (NEW)
- `dev/session6c_merge.py` (NEW)
- `dev/_session6c_batches/PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` + 6 batch JSONs (NEW)
- `dev/ref/stage6c-summary.md` (NEW)
- `data/classified_6c/*.json` (NEW — 47 files preserved as 6c sub-agent output backup)
- `data/classified/*.json` (47 files merged: now carry Session 5 tags + PDF description)
- `output/backfill_diffs.csv` (NEW — 34 rows for human review)
- `output/games_enriched.csv`, `output/themes_features_by_market.xlsx`, `output/enrichment_report.html` (refreshed)

**Note:** No code changes to the main pipeline (`main.py`, `agents/`) this session — pure backfill work using infrastructure built in 6a/6b plus the new merge/diff helper.

### Session 6b — PDF enrichment SLOTS3 tail (Claude Code)
**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Status:** Complete. Run back-to-back with 6a (user opted in despite token-budget warning).
**Token category:** Feature 100%

**What was done:**
- Built `dev/session6b_batches.py` (clone of 6a builder, dedup-aware against existing classified set).
- Reused `dev/_session6a_batches/PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` verbatim — only batch path changed.
- 54 NEW base_keys (50 SLOTS3 + 4 BINGO) → 7 batches → 3 waves (3-3-1).
- Validation: all 7 checks pass for 138 PDF-sourced JSONs.
- 0 PP candidate hits this session (total still 4, all from 6a). Confirms SLOTS3/BINGO PDFs typically don't describe the 4 sanctioned PP mechanics.
- Coverage: 228 → 278 enriched market rows (+50). SPAIN +44 (SLOTS3 is Spain-dominant); other markets +0–3.
- AM Spain gap: 152 → 110 rows (down 42).

**Files created/modified:**
- `dev/session6b_batches.py` (NEW)
- `dev/ref/stage6b-summary.md` (NEW)
- `data/classified/*.json` (54 new this session, 200 total)
- All `output/*.csv` and `output/themes_features_by_market.xlsx` refreshed
- `dev/projectlog.md` updated

**Note:** No code changes to the pipeline this session — pure classification work using infrastructure built in 6a.

### Session 7 — Untagged-games triage + mga.games Playwright scrape (Claude Code)
**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Status:** Complete. 240 web_extract JSONs in repo; classification deferred to Session 7b per plan.
**Token category:** Feature 95% / Bug fix 5%

**What was done:**
- Built `dev/untagged_triage.py` — read-only diagnostic CSV across all 6 AM markets, classifying every untagged row into Bucket A (no market_names entry), B (no source anywhere), C (PPTX/PDF/WEB exists but not enriched), or E (EXTERNAL). Reuses `_resolve_base_key_per_market` so the matcher mirrors what `generate_market_xlsx.find_base_key` does. Initial run: A=111, B=95, D=19, total 225.
- Generalised `agents/am_masterlist.py::load_am_spain` → new `load_am_market(path, sheet_name)`; old function preserved as a thin wrapper for `consolidator.py`.
- **Quick fix:** added cross-market fallback (`mn_exact_xmarket` + `mn_fuzzy_xmarket ≥92`) to `generate_market_xlsx.find_base_key`. Per-market xlsx coverage rose by exactly 19 rows (PORTUGAL +6, .COM +9, NL +1, COLOMBIA +3) — the original Bucket D becomes empty. Triage rerun: A=63, B=143, C=0, total 206.
- **mga.games scrape via Playwright** (public site is an Angular SPA — Vercel-hosted). Three iterations: (a) home modal works for SPAIN, (b) market chooser doesn't reappear after first selection, (c) clearing cookies + localStorage between markets forces modal each time → 6/6 markets enumerated correctly (212/55/103/26/23/34, 344 unique slugs, 453 (market, slug) tuples). Per-game pages cached idempotently in `dev/_scrape/games/<slug>.html` + `.json`.
- `dev/match_slugs.py` — joins scrape against `market_names.xlsx` via `_resolve_base_key_per_market`. 307/344 unique slugs (89%) resolve to a base_key; 40 unmatched slugs (Arabian Bingo, Carnaval Bingo, Sweet Home Bingo, Nacho Vidal Megaways, …) align with Bucket A — present on the public site but missing from market_names.xlsx.
- `dev/write_web_extracts.py` — emits 240 `data/web_extracts/<base_key>.json` files with the same shape as `data/pdf_extracts/`. raw_text combines the Spanish description + structured RESUMEN block (tipo / apuesta / volatilidad / premio_max).
- `dev/untagged_triage.py` extended with WEB coverage probe.
- Added Playwright (1.59.0) to the local Python env + chromium-headless-shell (~110MB binary) — not yet committed to `requirements.txt` since it's a recon tool, not pipeline-critical.

**Triage delta** (before → after scrape + web_extracts):
| Bucket | Before | After | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| A no market_names entry | 63 | 63 | 0 |
| B no source anywhere | 143 | **30** | **−113** |
| C source exists, ready to classify | 0 | **113** | **+113** |
| **Total untagged** | 206 | 206 | 0 |

**Files created/modified:**
- `agents/am_masterlist.py` — `load_am_market` (3 lines) + `load_am_spain` wrapper
- `generate_market_xlsx.py` — cross-market fallback in `find_base_key` (+18 lines)
- `dev/untagged_triage.py` (NEW, 316 lines)
- `dev/match_slugs.py` (NEW, 186 lines)
- `dev/scrape_mga.py` (NEW, 355 lines)
- `dev/scrape_mga_recon.py` (NEW, 183 lines — recon, can be deleted post-session)
- `dev/write_web_extracts.py` (NEW, 153 lines)
- `data/web_extracts/*.json` (NEW — 240 files, gitignored)
- `output/untagged_triage.csv` (NEW, gitignored — 206 untagged rows classified A/B/C/E)
- `dev/_scrape/{catalog.csv, games.csv, slug_to_base_key.csv, scrape_coverage.csv}` (NEW, gitignored)
- `dev/_scrape/games/*.{html,json}` (NEW — 344 games × 2, gitignored)
- `output/themes_features_by_market.xlsx` (refreshed — 19 D rows tagged)
- `.gitignore` — added `data/web_extracts/`, `data/classified_7/`, `dev/_recon/`, `dev/_scrape/games/`, `dev/_scrape/scrape.log`

**Risks / notes:**
- 30 Bucket B rows still untagged — games not on public mga.games (likely retired/regional-only).
- 63 Bucket A rows still untagged — no `market_names.xlsx` entry. Of these ~40 ARE on mga.games and we have the descriptions cached; could be filled in a separate session by adding new market_names rows or accepting slug as a pseudo base_key.
- `requirements.txt` not yet bumped to include Playwright. If a future session needs to rerun the scrape, install via `pip install playwright && python -m playwright install chromium`.

### Session 7b — Web-extract classification of Bucket C (Claude Code)
**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Status:** Complete. Bucket C now empty.
**Token category:** Feature 100%

**What was done:**
- Built `dev/session7b_batches.py` (sourced from `data/web_extracts/`, dedups against `data/classified/` → 84 NEW base_keys; the projectlog's 113 was the per-market row count, not unique base_keys).
- Built `dev/_session7b_batches/PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` — adapted from 6a's PDF template: web-source mode (always Spanish, always translate), output to `data/classified_7/`, schema uses `web_found: true` / `web_source_language: "ES"` / `pdf_found: false`, lower feature_confidence guidance (web is mechanic-light), added explicit Spanish-celebrity name list.
- Built `dev/validate_session7b.py` (7 checks) and `dev/session7b_merge.py`.
- Updated `agents/consolidator.py` — added `web_found` + `web_source_language` columns to `OUTPUT_COLUMNS` and `build_row()`.
- Dispatched 9 sub-agents in 3 waves of 3. Sub-agent total ~330k + main context ~30k = ~360k.
- Validation gate: all 7 checks pass for 84 web-sourced JSONs.
- Merged 84 new files into `data/classified/` (200 → 284). 0 collisions, 0 overwrites.
- Re-ran `localise` + `consolidate` + `generate_market_xlsx.py` + `generate_report.py`.

**PP candidates this session:** 0 hits — confirms web descriptions don't surface PP-style mechanic prose. Total still 4, all from 6a.

**Coverage delta** in `themes_features_by_market.xlsx` (enriched rows per market):
| Market | Pre | Post | Δ | Coverage % |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| SPAIN | 127 | 190 | +63 | 81.9% |
| PORTUGAL | 51 | 58 | +7 | 86.6% |
| .COM | 69 | 93 | +24 | 77.5% |
| NETHERLANDS | 16 | 21 | +5 | 91.3% |
| ITALY | 23 | 27 | +4 | **100.0%** |
| COLOMBIA | 11 | 21 | +10 | 61.8% |
| **Total** | **297** | **410** | **+113** | — |

ITALY now fully covered. Total enriched market rows up exactly +113 — matches the original Bucket C target.

**Triage delta** (`output/untagged_triage.csv`): Bucket C 113 → 0 (cleared); Bucket A 63 (unchanged); Bucket B 30 (unchanged); total untagged 206 → 93.

**Files created/modified:**
- `dev/session7b_batches.py` (NEW)
- `dev/validate_session7b.py` (NEW)
- `dev/session7b_merge.py` (NEW)
- `dev/_session7b_batches/PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` + 9 batch JSONs (NEW)
- `dev/ref/stage7b-summary.md` (NEW)
- `agents/consolidator.py` (modified — 2 new columns + 2 row fields)
- `data/classified_7/*.json` (NEW — 84 files preserved as sub-agent backup)
- `data/classified/*.json` (84 newly merged; total 284)
- `output/games_enriched.csv` (284 rows × 24 cols, +2 web columns)
- `output/themes_features_by_market.xlsx` (refreshed — +113 enriched rows)
- `output/celebrity_corrections.csv` (60 → 77 audit rows)
- `output/enrichment_report.html`, `output/untagged_triage.csv` (refreshed)

**Risks / notes:** `localise` reports 136 no-match (vs. 52 pre-7b). Most new web-sourced games lack `_Es`/`_Pt`-style suffixes the family resolver expects. The market xlsx covers them via cross-market join, but `games_enriched.csv`'s `markets` column may be empty for many — acceptable for now.

### Session 8 — Bucket A resolver fix + web-extract classification (Claude Code)
**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Status:** Complete.
**Token category:** Bug fix 50% / Feature 50%

**What was done:**
- Diagnosed Bucket A: 63 rows split into 43 naming-mismatch (AM has `Bingo`/`Megaways`/`Plus` suffix that market_names lacks) + 20 truly-new. Decided to fix the resolver rather than add 43 redundant rows to `market_names.xlsx`.
- **Code fix:** added `mn_loose` / `mn_loose_xmarket` fallback steps to `agents/pdf_extractor.py::_resolve_base_key_per_market` (used by `untagged_triage.py`, `match_slugs.py`, PDF pipeline) and the parallel `generate_market_xlsx.py::find_base_key`. Strips `{bingo, megaways, plus, deluxe, rf}` edge tokens + inner whitespace, then exact-equality on the loose form. Pure additive — only fires when stricter steps fail.
- **Pipeline knock-on:** re-running `match_slugs.py` resolved 18 more scrape slugs; `write_web_extracts.py` produced 240→258 web_extracts; 17 weren't yet classified.
- Built `dev/session8_batches.py` + `dev/validate_session8.py` + `dev/session8_merge.py` (clones of 7b infra). 2 sub-agent batches in parallel. Validation gate: all 7 checks pass.
- Merged 17 → `data/classified/` (284 → 301). Re-ran `localise` + `consolidate` + `generate_market_xlsx.py` + `generate_report.py`.

**Sub-agent total:** ~71k tokens (37k + 34k, parallel ~75s wall-clock).

**Coverage delta** in `themes_features_by_market.xlsx`:
| Market | Pre | Post | Δ | Coverage % |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| SPAIN | 190 | 214 | +24 | 92.2% |
| PORTUGAL | 58 | 61 | +3 | 91.0% |
| .COM | 93 | 114 | +21 | 95.0% |
| NETHERLANDS | 21 | 21 | 0 | 91.3% |
| ITALY | 27 | 27 | 0 | **100.0%** |
| COLOMBIA | 21 | 30 | +9 | 88.2% |
| **Total** | **410** | **467** | **+57** | — |

**Triage delta:**
| Bucket | Pre-8 | Post-resolver-fix only | Post-classify | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| A | 63 | 22 | 22 | −41 |
| B | 30 | 53 | 14 | −16 |
| C | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Total untagged** | **93** | 75 | **36** | **−57** |
| % blank | 18.5% | 14.9% | **7.2%** | −11.3pp |

**PP candidates:** 0 new hits this session. Total still 4, all from 6a.

**Files created/modified:**
- `agents/pdf_extractor.py` (loose fallback + helpers)
- `generate_market_xlsx.py` (loose fallback + helper)
- `dev/untagged_triage.py` (method-set tweak)
- `dev/write_web_extracts.py` (METHOD_RANK extension)
- `dev/session8_batches.py`, `dev/validate_session8.py`, `dev/session8_merge.py` (NEW)
- `dev/_session8_batches/PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` + 2 batch JSONs (NEW)
- `dev/ref/stage8-summary.md` (NEW)
- `data/classified_8/*.json` (NEW — 17 files)
- `data/classified/*.json` (17 newly merged; total 301)
- `data/web_extracts/*.json` (+18 → 258 total)
- `output/games_enriched.csv` (301 rows)
- `output/themes_features_by_market.xlsx` (+57 enriched rows)
- `output/celebrity_corrections.csv` (87 audit rows)
- `output/enrichment_report.html`, `output/untagged_triage.csv` (refreshed)
- `.gitignore` (added Session 8 paths)

**Risks / notes:**
- 22 truly-new Bucket A games still untagged. ~10 have public mga.games pages cached but lack `market_names.xlsx` entries; closing them needs synthesized rows (Product team input on canonical names recommended). The Dutch ones (`Ayla de Zwart Far West Mania Megaways`, `Neem het Geld Megaways`) look like celebrity- or language-localised variants of existing base_keys.
- 14 Bucket B residue — likely retired/regional-only. Close as "coverage ceiling" item.
- `localise` no-match: 136 → 153. New web-only base_keys still lack `_Es` suffixes. Cross-market join handles the per-market xlsx.

---

### Session 9 — Bucket A close-out (Claude Code)
**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Status:** Complete. Bucket A reduced to 2 truly-orphaned rows (coverage ceiling).
**Token category:** Feature 100%

**What was done:**
- Investigated each of the 22 remaining Bucket A rows; categorised into 3 classes:
  - 12 ALIAS rows pointing to already-classified existing base_keys (Maria La Piedra En Troya → S3TroyaCountersGlobal, Hawaii 5-0 → S3HawaiiCountersGlobal, El Cartel Plus Navidad → S3ElCartelNavidadCountersGlobal, etc.).
  - 4 cross-market variants (Dream3Team .COM/PT/CO; NL Far West Mania = celebrity variant; NL Take the Money = Dutch translation) — synthesised per-market suffix tablenames so suffix-stripping resolves to the canonical SPAIN base_key.
  - 4 NEW base_keys requiring classification (Aramis Fuster, Dream 3 Team SPAIN, Nacho Vidal Megaways, Ruleta Magic Red).
- Built `dev/session9_apply_mn_rows.py` — backs up `market_names.xlsx` and appends 20 new rows. Idempotent.
- Re-ran `match_slugs.py` + `write_web_extracts.py` (258 → 263 web_extracts; 4 unclassified base_keys).
- 1 sub-agent batch (4 games, ~32k tokens). Validation: all 7 checks pass.
- Merged → `data/classified/` (301 → 305). Re-ran `localise` + `consolidate` + `generate_market_xlsx.py` + `generate_report.py`.

**Sub-agent total:** ~32k tokens (1 batch, ~50s wall-clock).

**Coverage delta** in `themes_features_by_market.xlsx`:
| Market | Pre | Post | Δ | Coverage % |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| SPAIN | 214 | 226 | +12 | 97.4% |
| PORTUGAL | 61 | 63 | +2 | 94.0% |
| .COM | 114 | 117 | +3 | 97.5% |
| NETHERLANDS | 21 | **23** | +2 | **100.0%** |
| ITALY | 27 | 27 | 0 | 100.0% |
| COLOMBIA | 30 | 31 | +1 | 91.2% |
| **Total** | **467** | **487** | **+20** | — |

NETHERLANDS now joins ITALY at full coverage. SPAIN at 97.4%.

**Triage delta:**
| Bucket | Pre-9 | Post-9 | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| A | 22 | **2** | **−20** |
| B | 14 | 14 | 0 |
| C | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Total untagged** | **36** | **16** | **−20** |
| % blank | 7.2% | **3.2%** | −4.0pp |

**PP candidates:** 0 new hits this session. Total still 4, all from 6a.

**Files created/modified:**
- `config/market_names.xlsx` (700 → 720 rows; backup at `config/market_names.bak.session9-*.xlsx`)
- `dev/session9_apply_mn_rows.py`, `dev/validate_session9.py`, `dev/session9_merge.py` (NEW)
- `dev/_session9_batches/PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` + 1 batch JSON (NEW)
- `dev/ref/stage9-summary.md` (NEW)
- `data/classified_9/*.json` (NEW — 4 files)
- `data/classified/*.json` (4 newly merged; total 305)
- `data/web_extracts/*.json` (+5 → 263 total)
- `output/games_enriched.csv` (305 rows)
- `output/themes_features_by_market.xlsx` (+20 enriched rows)
- `output/celebrity_corrections.csv` (87 → 111 audit rows)
- `output/enrichment_report.html`, `output/untagged_triage.csv` (refreshed)
- `.gitignore` (added Session 9 paths)

**Risks / notes:**
- 2 Bucket A residual: `Deus Dos Mares` (PORTUGAL) and `Cosmic Monsters Party` (.COM). No public mga.games entry, no MN row, no related family — needs source content or Product input. Genuine "coverage ceiling".
- 14 Bucket B unchanged — older/regional/never-public-marketed titles. Closing requires source files.
- `market_names.xlsx` has 20 synthesized rows with empty Gameid/Enum. Pipeline ignores those columns; safe for SEO output but they'd be flagged if anything ever joined back to the master DB.
- PORTUGAL "Popeye Caça Tesouros" was aliased to SPAIN canonical `S3PopeyeCountersGlobal` (not PT-specific) — sharing classification is appropriate since the games are translated text only. Re-pointable later if PT-specific source ever gets classified.

## Current status
**Phase:** Phase 9 complete. Per-market xlsx coverage: SPAIN 226/232 (97.4%), PORTUGAL 63/67 (94.0%), .COM 117/120 (97.5%), NETHERLANDS 23/23 (100.0%), ITALY 27/27 (100.0%), COLOMBIA 31/34 (91.2%). Total enriched market rows: **487** (was 467). Untagged: **16 total** = 2 Bucket A + 14 Bucket B. % blank: **3.2%** (was 7.2%).
**Blocker:** None. Product reviews still pending; remaining 16 untagged rows are coverage ceiling.

**Outstanding (in priority order):**
1. **Bucket B (14 rows)** — older / regional / never-public-marketed titles. Need source content from Product team or accept as ceiling.
2. **Bucket A (2 rows)** — `Deus Dos Mares` (PORTUGAL), `Cosmic Monsters Party` (.COM). Truly off-site; no related family. Needs Product team confirmation or new source.
3. Product team to review `output/missing_mechanics_review.xlsx` AND `output/pp_mechanic_candidates.csv` (4 hits) — confirm green-lit mechanics → bump taxonomy to v2.4 → re-classify affected games.
4. Product team to review `output/backfill_diffs.csv` (34 rows) — decide whether any Session 5 vs. 6c disagreements warrant overriding Session 5's authoritative tags.
5. Product team to review `output/celebrity_corrections.csv` (111 rows after 9) — confirm strict-full-name policy is right.
6. Optional: refactor `main.py` (still 673 lines) — split each `cmd_*` into `agents/cli/<command>.py`.
7. Optional: fix `localisation_resolver.match_extract_to_family` no-match for 179/305 (SPAIN/.COM cname masking quirk + new web-only base_keys without canonical _Es suffix).
8. Slots5/Bingo legacy PPTXs not yet downloaded — when they arrive, extractor picks them up via numeric-prefix pattern.
